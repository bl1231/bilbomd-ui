# bilbomd-ui

`bilbomd-ui` is the frontend GUI for BilboMD. It is an SPA created with CRA. The deploy [instructions](https://github.com/bl1231/bilbomd#2-deploy-the-bilbomd-front-end-ui) give details of using PM@ to deploy a production instance to `https://bilbomd.bl1231.als.lbl.gov`, but if you want to start a development version you can just check this code out and fire it up interactively.
